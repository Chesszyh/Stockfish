Welcome to the nnue-pytorch wiki!

It's currently WIP, but in the future you will find here the following things:

* common problems when trying to run the trainer
* various way of how to train networks
* detailed information about the various knobs that can be adjusted
* how to oversee the training process, what to expect, what to look for
* how the architecture is defined and how to modify it
* everything about datasets and hyperparameters
* how the datasets are produced and how to make your own
* what the best practices for training are
* fundamental results that will broaden your understanding of NNUE

This wiki will be mostly concerned with training NNUE networks and high level NNUE features. If you're looking for a technical, in-depth, low level documentation of NNUE you can find it [here](https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md).
